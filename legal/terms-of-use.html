Opting out of one or more ad networks only means that those particular members no longer will deliver targeted content or ads to you. It does not mean you will no longer receive any targeted content or ads on our websites or other third party websites. If your browser is configured to reject Cookies when you visit one of the above referenced opt-out pages, and you later erase your Cookies, use a different computer or change Web browsers, your preference may no longer be active. Since all of these Cookies are managed by third parties, you should refer to the third parties’ own website privacy notifications and policies for further information (see below for more information about the particular targeting Cookies used on our Website).</p><p>Users in the United States may opt out of many third-party ad networks. For example, you may go to the Digital Advertising Alliance (“DAA”) Consumer Choice Page for information about opting out of interest-based advertising and their choices regarding having information used by DAA companies. You may also go to the Network Advertising Initiative (“NAI”) Consumer Opt-Out Page for information about opting out of interest-based advertising and their choices regarding having information used by NAI members.</p><p>Opting out from one or more companies listed on the DAA Consumer Choice Page or the NAI Consumer Opt-Out Page will opt you out from those companies’ delivery of interest-based content or ads to you, but it does not mean you will no longer receive any advertising through our Website or on other websites. You may continue to receive advertisements, for example, based on the particular website that you are viewing (i.e., contextually based ads). Also, if your browsers are configured to reject Cookies when you opt out on the DAA or NAI websites, your opt out may not be effective. Additional information is available on the DAA’s website at <a href="https://www.aboutads.info" target="_blank">www.aboutads.info</a> or the NAI’s website at <a href="https://www.networkadvertising.org" target="_blank">www.networkadvertising.org</a>.</p><h3 id="do-not-track">DO NOT TRACK</h3><p>Currently, our systems do not recognize browser “do-not-track” requests.
